# Moment-rotation-Curve-Predictor
This is a Tkinter-based GUI application that predicts moment-rotation curves for beam to column bolted connections using a pre-trained XGBoost regression model. The application also provides SHAP-based explanations to show the impact of input parameters on the predictions.
